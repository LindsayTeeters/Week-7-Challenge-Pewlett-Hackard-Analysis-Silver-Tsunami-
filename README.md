# Week-7-Challenge-Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis-Silver-Tsunami-
Week 7 Challenge

## Overview of the analysis
Bobby's manager at Pewlett Hackard has asked us to provide him an analysis of retiring employees. He would like to know the name and titles of the retiring employees. He would also like to know the names of the employees who would begin to participate in the mentorship program. The retiring age we are using for this analysis is for employees withing the birthdate range of January 1st, 1952 through December 31st, 1955. The mentorhsip program is for employees who are within the birthdate range of January 1st through December 31st, 1965. 

## Results

Within this course we learning about tables and how to join tables together. A good visual for this was the DBD and ERD. The DBD tool that we utilized was [Quick DBD](http://quickdatabasediagrams.com/). This allowed us to visually see relationships between tables.

Pewlett Hackard has 300,024 employees listed within their employee dataframe. Thee age of these employees is pretty evenly spread out from 57 years of age and 70 years of age. Each birth year averages 7% of the total number of employees. The total number of employees who have retired over the years is 133,776. That is 45% of the total number of employees listed.

Couple of key takeaways:
  * Managers aren't high on the retirement list. They either step down before they retire or few have actually retired.
  * Engineers make up the highest percent of employees retiring. 
      * This isn't that much higher than general Staff, Senior Engineers, or Senior Staff.
  * 87% of the retired employees, started before the new millennium.
  * Fun fact: Guther is the top first name of retired employees.
  * The Senior Staff and Engineers have the most employees that can participate in the mentorship elgibility. This correlates to the number of retirees.
